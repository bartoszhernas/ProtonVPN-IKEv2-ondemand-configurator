# ProtonVPN-IKEv2-ondemand-configurator

A client-side JavaScript application to generate an 'On Demand' IKEv2 profile incorporating custom username, password and server.

ProtonVPN's current guide does not allow 'on demand', so your connection will drop leaving you exposed.

I've created the configuration file thanks to [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonVPN/comments/7qkj7m/creating_an_ondemand_ikev2_configuration_profile/)

Simply:

    Enter your details into the script (live example at https://govt.is/proton.html)

    Email the saved file to your iPhone

    Follow the prompts on your phone

The script is client-side Javascript, nothing is sent to the server.

**At this stage the script is highly experimental, please only proceed if you are comfortable with this sort of setup. I also value feedback and current bugs**

This is in no way endorsed by ProtonVPN.
